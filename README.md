# Differ

## Presentation

**Differ** is a tools that compares two folders.
- Used as an API, it returns the differences.
- Used as a standalone program, it prints the differentes.

## Use-case

I have developped **Differ** to check that I don't miss anything when I perform manual backup (on my NAS).
I don't like the principle of synchronizing folders because of the unattented deleting risk.
I copy my files from folder A to folder B and I check with **Differ** if :
- something new has not been backuped yet
- something has changed an not been backuped yet
